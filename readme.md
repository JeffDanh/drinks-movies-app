<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
Have you ever wanted to watch a movie and realized you needed a drink? But the problem is, you don't know what drink you want. That's where Moviology comes in! 

The purpose of this project is to create a fun, user friendly site to assist people in their movie searches. Unlike most movie website, Moviology is different in that based on the cateogry of movie selected, the program will randomly choose a drink of a certain type (i.e. wine, tequila)

Also, the user can create a profile and login as well as submit reviews for the movies. These pieces of information will store in our database.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
For this project, you will need to have a source code editor. You will need to install node along with the following packages:
axios, bluebird, body-parser, ejs, express, pg, pg-hstore, and sequelize.

If you plan on deploying your project, a domain name needs to be purchased. The site can be launched on Amazon Web Services(AWS) along with creating and connecting your PostgreSQL relational database. Due to the lengthy process, the documentation for these two items have been attached.... <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">Launching on AWS</a> & <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/create-connect-postgresql-db/">Connecting PostgreSQL Database.</a>
